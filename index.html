                        Welcome to my portfolio. I am <strong>Sara Alinazari</strong>
                        a software and Full-stack Developer with a focus on backend. My passion is back-end programming and providing 
                        solutions for complicated issues. I am keen to get involved with complicated 
                        programming algorithms. Having experience in programming integrated with 
                        excellent knowledge of business helped me to see the issues out of the box and be 
                        able to provide comprehensive solutions to improve  business.

                                I started my job in Gas Engineering and Development Co. Project which was a 
                                contractor job. They have a CMS with static pages. They needed to change their website to dynamic 
                                one. As I was the only web developer in that company, it was such a great opportunity to learn 
                                different skills.

                                This company was a governmental company. As you may guess they had a lot of 
                                religious rules which I had to obey. This was not my style. I did not want to 
                                pretend I was a religious person while I was not. At last, I could not accept 
                                the culture and I ran out of this company. I decided to pursue my goal to get 
                                a master instead of working in the company with the culture that does not match 
                                with my values.

                                Having the knowledge of technical side is awsome but I really liked to know
                                about management side. I wanted to know how we could manage a software project 
                                efficiently. My job in Gas Engineering and Development Co encouraged me to know 
                                more about project managemengt as this company managed a lot of national gas porjects.
                                I started my master in Executive managemengt in Payam Noor University, Tehran, Iran.

                               As Iran was under sanction, finding data for map and GPS routing was like a pain in the neck,
                               I can say it was impossible. Due to the fact that they neede to buy data and selling any strategic
                               data to Iranian companies was restricted internationally.
                               So they dropped the project.

                                I really enjoyed working in this company. This bank was a new bank at the time. I was 
                                among the first employees they hired. There were wide range of responsiblities associated 
                                to the position from computer science to marketing. As they was new, they were open to new and creative ideas which I kept me interested

                                I had always been so intrested in living in other countries. I have a personality that I cannot be static 
                                for a long time. I feel bored when the life is routine and everything seems calm and quiet. I 
                                always need some challenge. I decided to leave my good job, family, and friends to pursue my dreams of 
                                studying and living in USA. I came to USA alone (Who makes this crazy decision😱). I started a really adventurous
                                and stressfull life that I have never got bored since then😄. Every day and every minute has been like a class to learn
                                life skills. I appreciate the decision I made as it helped me to know myself more than before. 
                                All of hardship I went through made me better person.

                                Being a Graduate assistant was my first job in USA. It gave me the opportunity to have time to 
                                learn about the culture in USA. Also, I did not have to commute a lot as my workplace was the university 
                                that I was full time student. It gave the opportunity to be help in academic researches, too.

                                I got my Master in MBA from CSULB in USA. That was such a breakthrough for me. I

                              After having my first job, I felt I need to get back to the technology. I needed to 
                              use my knowledge in computer science and like to go back to use my critical thinking. I 
                              figured out that I would be happier when I did programming. It was fun for me. Then I thought why
                              I should not go back to computer science? I decided to pursue my job in this field. I started searching 
                              for a good Bootcamp coding.
